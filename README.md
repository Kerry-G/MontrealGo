# MontrealGO

## Inspiration

We wanted to create an application that could give you a sample of information about your city that use Reddit, an curated source of information and multiple other APIs.

## What it does

Uses Reddit as a database for different data sets and presents it with a messenger bot to the client


## What we learned
    - How to serve flask on a server
    - How to use python for a full stack connected with various API such as praw and the messenger API and open Weather API

## What's next for MontrealGO

MontrealGO becomes InternationalGO and we used what we have developed in a general framework where it can be accessed throughout the world.
